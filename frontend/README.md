Frontend (Minimal React-like demo)
=================================
This is a minimal static frontend (no React build) intentionally kept simple
so recruiters/testers can run the app instantly without complex setup.

Quick Start:
------------
1. cd frontend
2. npm install    # installs express for server
3. npm run dev    # starts simple static server on port 3000
4. Visit http://localhost:3000

Notes:
------
- The frontend expects the backend to run on http://localhost:4000
- For a full React app, replace public/ with a CRA or Vite app and update README accordingly.
